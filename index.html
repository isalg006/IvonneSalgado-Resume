        <div class="subheading mb-5">AccountantðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">As a first year college student my goal is to attain a bachelor's degree within these four years. I want to get a BS degree in accounting and perhaps minor in art since I enjoy painting just about anything. As a commuter at UCR (University of California, Riverside) finding people to connect with is hard, however, I was fortunate enough to have friends who enrolled in the same college as I did. Fall term for me was fun and a new experience that I would like to relive because of the professors I encountered last year. They were the ones who prepared and encouraged me to better myself this Winter term. Especially since transitioning from highschool to college accustoms was going to be a new challenge for me. Before entering college, in highschool I would procrastinate a lot and disliked taking notes because of the cornell style regulation that teachers would impose on their students. Hence, why my notes would be bland and messy, but now that I am in college I have more leverage with my notes. I enjoy making my notes pop and be full of life whenever I have color utensils with me. Sometimes for inspiration I go on pinterest and search up bullet journal templates in order to imitate the designs printed on the paper. Thanks to this new technique in note taking I am more motivated to study for exams and recall certain information from past lectures. This method is really handy during finals week when I have to remember the first week of lecture. Though I have resolved my note taking problem, I have yer to find a solution to my procrastination habit. During the first week of instruction everything starts off smoothly, but ends up  going south when work piles up. I try to prioritize homework that is due early on in the course, but brush off next week assignments a day before the task needs to be turned in. Sometimes the assignments are short and brief to the point where I can get them done on time, but this only motivates me to continue this bad habit of mine. There are times when I get my work done early, but those are rare occasions that only happen during midterm week. I have tried to set deadlines for each assignment, but my environment prevents me from staying on task. Especially since at home there is more commotions than at school. For that reason, whenever I am dropped off early at school I admittedly go to the Orbach library to start my assignments. This course of action allows me to get ahead in my work and have spare time to review my notes. As well as permits me to come up with questions I may have for the professor or TA that is instructing the course. I aim to control my bad habit by the end of this year in order to become more organized, flexible, and orientated with my studies before summer term.<br><br>

        Even though I lack work experience this involvement does not discourage me to keep job hunting. Instead of seeing this experience as a disadvantage I see this as an opportunity to be shaped into the employee that best suits the company's needs. I adapt fast, am a fast learner and am honest about my knowledge. If a contractor were to ask me about a certain topic I would simply let them know that I am not adequate enough to discuss the subject at hand, but will research the matter as soon as possible. Though my work experience is insignificant to my major I still like to get involved in different environments for the cultural diversity jobs have to offer. For instance, during the weekends I volunteer my time to an art teacher at Moreno Valley High School who instructs at different locations. Last summer we went to an air base full of children who wanted to learn about the arts of crafting. The art teacher had supplied the materials, while I directed the children into the craft stations: homemade cards, bead bracelets, Macaroni art, and finger painting. All the kids seemed to have a blast, but there was an incident where two children had spilled paint on the floor. What had happened was the children at the painting station had run out of blue paint and were impatient to ask for assistance. Since the blue paint was on top of the shelf the kids thought they could reach the paint, but ended up making a mess. Luckily the two kids informed us of their mistake and helped clean up the mess. The art teacher and I decided to reward the two kids with candy since they were mature enough to tell us what they had done. After lunch we made sure to hand out the candy bags we had prepared for the kids since they were all so well behaved. Working with children has taught me that patience and tone are key to dealing with children. Meanwhile jobs that deal with adolescents need more authority and confidence to keep under control. A way to get adolescent's attention is by having a game prepared with prizes in order to get them engaged in the lesson. One time during my spare time the art teacher and I had made a presentation for a highschool art class where we discussed the mediums of arts. The students were inattentive and talking over the presentation. Instead of yelling at the students and making a big fuss about the situation we simply pulled out our premade game. We informed the class that the top three winners would receive extra credit towards their class and attain a goodybag full of snacks. Once we announced this everyone was ready to listen and engage with our lesson. Knowing how to advertise your topic makes teaching easier for everyone. Especially when dealing with smaller and older students who are impatient with everything. As well as easily distracted by their phones.<br><br>

        My goal for the end of the school year is to become an accountant who works at a well known company such as Google, Apple, Disney, Amazon, or etc. I want to better understand how their companies function while indulging in their cultural diversity. Especially Disney who has become the greatest platform in the Twenty-first century as they inspire children through their films. I admire Disney for their creativity and imagination. They really emphasize that no dream is too big nor small to accomplish as long as you believe. As well as work hard towards your end goal. Meanwhile, companies like Google and Apple are innovators of the technology era. Google has helped low and middle class workers get access to the internet at a low cost. While Apple keeps improving their high quality resolutions to produce the best graphics and sound qualities. Unlike Apple, Google is an open source company that helps everyone benefit and obtain unlimited information. Like Google, I want my company to be accessible for everyone at a fair cost. The reason behind this is that I am well informed with low income problems our society has. Especially now that many people are having a hard time purchasing a house and end up living in their cars. A solution that my company would provide is setting up service plans that best suit the seller. Similar to Amazon and Netflix payment services where they offer monthly payments for a certain amount of features. This way the seller can still have access to the service main features, but if the customer chooses to have an extra feature they would simply need to pay more. By setting up this type of method the customer is not pressured into buying the whole package nor struggles to maintain their family. Though this vision of mine is still flawed and needs lots of reviewing I still strive to have a company that benefits everyone. The first step in making this dream of mine a reality is by applying to internships and getting an office job. As well as passing all my courses and taking my business classes seriously. So far I have learned the fundamentals of consumer behavior and effects of shifting demand curves. These two topics will play a major role when I start up my own company. The importance of consumer behavior is that this allows companies to oblige to a person's needs. For example, when providing a service the company must choose what they want to mainly focus on while sacrificing something for that decision. Such as McDonalds who provide fast food for a low price, which restricts them from selling expensive food. Whilst demanding shift curves help visualize the effects of supply and demand from customers. For instance if the supply of oranges from UCR were to decrease then the price and demand for the fruit would increase. By having a good amount of an item the better off a company is off making profit and keeping the customer satisfied.
